                        <p>SAVE believes that there is one primary trend that is affecting the lives of students across campus: growth. The University of Texas at Dallas is expanding at an astounding rate. This year, there are 19,000 students on campus; next year there will be 21,000. Both are record numbers. On the ballot alongside the names of student government candidates will be referenda concerning the creation of a &ldquo;Green Fee&rdquo;, expansion of the current Student Union and the building of an additional Recreation Center. Massive new academic facilities are being constructed as well, alongside new residential facilities. Such tremendous and sudden growth requires an enormous amount of planning and decision-making. Tasks that will face student government representatives in the upcoming year include transportation, dining, and housing issues, defending accepted referenda in front of the Texas State Legislature and UT Board of Regents, and providing a student voice in policy conversations. It is the job of any elected representative to ensure student input plays a major role in administrative decision-making in order to ensure that issues are resolved in a manner satisfactory to the student body and to ensure the long- term success of any initiatives.</p>
                        <p>This problem begets a new challenge: how to adequately and accurately assess the opinions of the student body. Current initiatives fail to generate a significant volume of input; having 300 people respond to a survey is typical. SAVE promises to energetically pursue a variety of mechanisms to reach out to the student body. Outreach programs, increased visibility and involvement around campus, and aggressive use of online tools such as social media and survey software can all lead to a more intimate and dynamic relationship between the student body and student government. This conversation will allow your representatives on student government to ensure that student voice is heard loud and clear by administrators at UT Dallas, as well as the Richardson community.</p>
