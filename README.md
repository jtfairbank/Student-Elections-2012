About the SAVE Website
======================
http://www.saveutdallas.org/

I created this website in the Spring of 2011 for my brother who was running, as
a Freshman, for Student Council President at UT Dallas.  Even though it isn't
technically or graphically impressive, it was a fun project that had a real-
world impact (see Analysis below).


Post-Election Analysis
----------------------
The website turned out to be a huge success.  10% of all students who voted in
the elections went through the link to the elections on SAVE's website, and
many more visited it in the preceding week.  All but one of SAVE's candidates
won their elections- that's a 93% success rate.
